# Surfs_up
Performing a climate analysis using SQLAlchemy, SQLite and Flask

Incorporated the Flask application to present data to key stakeholders using 5 route pathways to describe weather patterns in Oahu:
1. Welcome
2. Precipitation
3. Stations
4. Monthly Temperature
5. Statistics

## Challenge: Find Oahu's seasonal weather data 
### The goals of this challenge:
1. Determine key statistical data about the month of June and December
2. Compare findings between both months
3. Give 2-3 Recommendations for further analysis.
4. Share findings in Jupyter Notebook.

Recommendations- 
1. Expand the analysis further-- the weather statistics needs to be made across a wider range of months and not be so absolute (only June and December). Seasons and flow of travel and tourism across a year is not isolated to only two months out of the year.
2. When the data for June or December for all stations and years is filtered and viewed, it is missing certain days of recorded values. A good task to further verify any chance of errors or discrepancies in the results is to check how many recordings are missing by date. 
3. Route presentations should aim to be more visually stimulating. Import graphs and clean tables, not lists or dictionaries.
