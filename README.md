# Surfs_up
Performing a climate analysis using SQLAlchemy, SQLite and Flask

Created five route pathways using the Flask application to guide and present key stakeholders data that describe weather patterns in Oahu:
1. Welcome | 2. Precipitation | 3. Stations | 4. Monthly Temperature | 5. Weather Statistics (choosing a start and end date)

## Challenge: Find Oahu's seasonal weather data 
### The goals of this challenge:
1. Determine key statistical data about the month of June and December
2. Compare findings between both months
3. Give 2-3 Recommendations for further analysis.
4. Share findings in Jupyter Notebook.

## Key Statistical Data: June and December Months *(all stations and years)*
#### Statistics for June (left) and December (right)

### Recommendations
1. Comparing June and December findings: December months tend to have slightly more rain than June months and the months of June tend to have higher temperatures. Generally the data is very similar and Oahu proves to be a good place for a surf & ice cream shop.
2. There is a need to expand the analysis further to show the weather statistics across a wider range of months. Showing results for only June and December is very absolute, and climate patterns or seasonal activity is highly distributed and the flow of travel and tourism across a year should not be isolated to only two months out of the year.
3. June and December data for all stations and years is missing certain days of recorded values. In order to further analyze results and have more accurate statistics it is important to count how many recordings are missing by date. 
4. Route presentations should aim to be more visually stimulating. Such as importing graphs and clean tables instead of lists or dictionaries to make the data more comprehensible to key stakeholders.
